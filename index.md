## this-morning-you-step-outside

This morning you step outside \
Take a stride, show your might 

The first to come, a war of words \
Knowledge spilt on parchments

Like NLP, you'll conquer all \
Come back home and take a fall 

On the bed until you rise again \
Show them what you have gained 

A nerd is what you look like  \
But you don't back down from a fight 

Determined is how I put it \
While headstrong also fits

You work hard my dear, \
Are smart to boot, 

A force to be reckoned \
The ace for whom it beckons

The result you want is right there \
You rest well then get up here 😚
