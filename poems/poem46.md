## Morning sunshine

As I open my eyes \
To the morning sunshine \

On my lips I feel your taste \
In my brain your thoughts remain \

I turn around and pick up my phone \
In my head sound your pretty little moans \

Your text reads good morning dear \
I respond with "I'm right here" \

With flushed cheeks and a wide smile \
I wait on you for a while \

A kiss emoji is what you send \
Oh how I don't want this morning to end \

With you near and yet so far \
To me you're my lovely star \

The moonlight to my dark nights \
The colour to my grey life \

And even when this honeymoon ends \
Together in space-time we'll create a bend \

I look forward to taking this journey \
Where we etch our story in eternity
