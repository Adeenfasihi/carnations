## Longball game

Found a person so attractive \
Without her close the world seems inactive

Running from a standstill \
Sitting by the window sill

Reminiscing the moments we had \
Ravishing, the thought of your hands

Intertwining thoughts and our fingers \
Letting go of any unease that lingers

Noticing your eyes full of desire \
You're the one that I admire

Limited time we got together \
Increase in passion, it brought us

Eventful days that they were \
Entranced by your murmurs

The next we get to experience it \
Will be sooner than you might think

With joy we will reap what we sowed \
The effort put, and all we vowed

It's a longball game so let's stay in \
In the end, my dearest, we will win
