## Friday

At the end of the week we say \
Thank God it's Friday! \

The weekend is nearby \
Life's been on a highway \

A moment to relax that we require \
Your mind, your body, your soul I admire \

As the rain falls like the longing for you \
To loneliness I grow more immune \

The 2 months that have passed by \
With you, my darling, I want to fly \

To the ends of the earth and back again \
You're my home from where I begin \

Preparing for the best of all \
We will have to wait for fall \

For now I want to wish you my dear \
A Monthsary that has come so near \

Hafsa, thank you for staying by my side \
You make my life worth a while
