## Shore

Entrancing waves hit the shore \
Her words dance in his brain as he snores \
Her voice sweet, her words deep \
Filling the otherwise empty mind, in his sleep

Sweet lullabies, and declarations of love \
Envelop him as if they're showers of bliss \
Oh but the incorrect lyrics and the way she sings \
She makes his stormy seas calm down, within

Who knew mere words could be so moving \
So entrancing and love inducing \
To those who have never adored \
You'd do yourself a favour \
If you were to try some more
