## Longest day

It is the longest day of the year (21st June) \
I thought of you every minute, my dear \

As the sun shone in the summery skies \
I got reminded of your beautiful eyes \

Every step I took this day \
Has been meaningful towards paving the way \

Towards a future that I see for us \
I realise growth has to be a must \

I mentioned you to my team mate \
He beamed when he heard your name \

We lurked around the castle hill \
You were running through my mind, still \

Snuck away to chat with you \
I couldn't help but smile all through \

I'm sorry I acted out so rude \
I thought I had to get back soon \

In a hurry I texted you my boo \
With unrefined words that slipped out too \

I wish to sincerely apologise \
I want to give you much more time \

You had a rough day and were so low \
I added onto it and didn't come slow \

Please forgive me my beautiful darling \
For being such a bitch on parting \

I did not want to leave you like that \
What I wanted was to get you to sleep fast \

So you could get proper sleep, energy and \
Finish your work while tying loose ends
