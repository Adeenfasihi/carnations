## Work hard, play hard

Work hard, play hard \
Is something we've been told, \
from the start

You my love, give your all \
To your duties, to your fights \
To family, love, work, studies, your life, \
Your friends, and all of mankind

Inside, a kind soul, a soft heart \
Outside, a beautiful smile \
A loving gaze, all warm like

Life doing things that it does \
But you've to bear it the worst

Ripped apart, into shreds \
Broken, with many bends

Happiness is all you desire \
Though every time you get put into fire

The heartbreaks have got to end \
Life has yet to lend \
Peace to you and your kin \
A content existence within

With all this hardship, will come ease \
Make you feel like floating in the breeze

The days are not too far off \
Where you will get the reward of \
All the suffering, all the pain \
Forever to go and never to come again
