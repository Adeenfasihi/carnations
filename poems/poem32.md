## I fell in love with myself

I fell in love with myself \
On a day when I feel burned out

A thought of you brings out a smile \
My lips have learned to curl, after a while

The feelings I get from looking at my reflection \
Even the mirror beams at my affection

Getting stuff for home, but enough for two \
Having food and imagining it with you, boo

My chipper chatter feels a bit foreign \
For you, my love, I tend to go all in

From the birthday last year and all my hate \
Has turned on its own as of late

To whom I adore and express this for \
A depth to the heart never felt before

Being the reason for your smile my little elf \
I fell in love with myself
