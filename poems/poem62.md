## Longing

Lying in bed in the middle of the night \
A longing nags at the back of my mind

Let's go back to a place we met \
Sitting in the car my brother had let

You lightly caressed my cheek \
When I was with you for less than a week

That touch of magic lit up a fire \
An inferno arose in the mire

The phone call in the airport \
Oh my love how I adore

You call my name in a thun thun way \
Asking me to come home and lay

Beside you and hold you in my arms \
The memories come in a swarm

Lying in bed in the middle of the night \
A longing engulfs all of my mind
