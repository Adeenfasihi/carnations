## Moon & Clouds

The moon shines between the clouds \
A whiff of a dream reminds you about \

The past days, a beautiful haze \
Memories where you belong \

Roads that you walked along \
People you wish to see \

How they are doing today \
Thinking of you, who can say \

Delightful were those times you miss \
Embedded in your brain they stay \

Going back in this reel of life \
Nostalgic they make you feel \

How someone once said to you \
You look beautiful as you smile through \

The good days that you have seen \
Keep them in mind, they make you beam
