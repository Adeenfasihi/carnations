## Rusty leaves

Rusty leaves fall from the trees \
Dew drops flail in the breeze \
On top of the mountain \
Lie two beasts \
Tired and bloody they barely breathe \

Embodiment of souls akin \
Yet massive differences rife within \
The faith in both so astounding \
None gave thought to giving in \

With a few breaths love raised its head \
Found the demon amiss a breath \
Victory was within its reach \
But love being love it couldn't leave \
A tired body, an existence naive \

Though the problem never was a clear \
The demon shouldn't disappear \
With a hand to hold it could be near \
A life too bold to consider it dear \

Once a warm and a kindred spirit \
Asks to be nice it wouldn't inhibit \
Perhaps it could turn your way \
Or it may raise havoc therein \

Don't be scared for love once won \
Given the chance it's second to none \
With its power you can control \
The beast within and even more \
It may bark, it may bite \
It's a fact that this is life \

But you're strong and your love's alike \
And to fight these wars \
You need good sleep at night \

If in dreams it's hard to best \
I'm right here to bear the rest \

So go at it with all your might, \
And rest assured you can fall back alright
