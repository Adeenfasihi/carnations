## Acceptance

When your eyes look into mine \
I get a feeling so divine \

My cheeks get flushed \
And my voice gets hushed \

I try to find words to express what I feel \
To verbalise things and make you understand \

But now and then, at times all I do \
Is find a pillow to bury my face into \

The words I say just flow right out \
For which I don't have to think twice about \

You accept my love and dearly so \
For you vocalise how close it's to you \

Perhaps it will take a bit of time \
With which you could internalise \

Not just have acceptance in \
But also belief surely within \

I am very grateful to you for \
All of this and so much more
