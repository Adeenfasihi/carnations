## Shifting routine

As day fades to night \
Buds bloom into life \
We realise how change \
Is the only constant \
So we strive to make \
The best of today \
Which may be in disarray \
As priorities align \
Routine starts shifting \
Old habits start shrinking \
New & different is how we verbalise it \
In order to make peace within \
The only thing that doesn't change \
Is the love we have for each other \
If not more, it's definitely not less
