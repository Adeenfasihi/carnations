## Field of blooms

In a field of blooms \
A snap of a twig leads to gloom

The chirping birds fly away \
Momentarily pause the day

A no, a stop, a snap of a twig \
Interrupting rudely the peaceful bliss

This twig with the power of a nuclear bomb \
Wreaks havoc in this field of love

An apology doesn't bring the birds back \
But it's sorry with an important fact

It understands the rudeness that it caused \
The consequences where birds don't flock

It's a work in progress to be much better \
Here's the ending of this letter
