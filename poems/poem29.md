## Protagonist

When you're high or you're low \
Among your pretty hair that flows

Sometimes wavy sometimes curly \
I wanna bury my face in without hurry

While your eyes look pretty in the dark \
Your smile lights up the room across and far

The dimples on your cheeks so cute \
They're something that can change the mood

Whoever experiences your energy \
Can never find so much with ease

Your softie nature shines through \
As the feelings of love start to brew

What a big magician you are \
Being so small and yet a star

You're the protagonist of my life \
I love the fact that you're my wife ;)

I write this poem for you to see \
How perfect I believe you are for me

So come and lie on this chest \
Forget the world and have some rest
