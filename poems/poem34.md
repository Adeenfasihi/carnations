## Focused

With a focused gaze you work through \
Unfazed by the chatter around you \
Fatigue kicks in and you lay back \
Rub your neck with your hand \
Don a big smile in response to my kisses \
The cutest pose I'm not afraid to admit \
Hands up in the air as you stretch away \
A moan, a sigh, a deep breath that sways \
To observe you in your everyday life \
Oh how privileged I am to be enveloped by your light \
Virtual hugs keep you going \
Airy pecks to the cheeks, flowing \
Your attention is a gift to me \
Sharing things like it should be \
I am here, my love, my life \
A home where you can relax \
Being proud of you comes by default \
Given how amazing you are, my wife ;)
