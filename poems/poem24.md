## Potion

I'm in need of a potion \
I look at what is in the fridge \
There's a cocktail of emotions \
I turn back to look at you and glitch \
For you have me, mind and body, bewitched

As I leave the home that I've started to own \
Bittersweet feelings pour out on parole \
Moving to a new place with you supporting me \
I'm left wondering what's written in our destiny

I will be moving close to the sea \
At long last we will be connected by its breeze \
Until we meet, and none can put us asunder \
We will brave through all that thunder
