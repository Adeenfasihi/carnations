## Homewards

Cheerful steps head homeward \
Smiling face that glows up

On the mention of you, oh my love \
The world brightens with colours

These grey skies part \
Making way for sunshine

Acting as a spotlight \
Over the skin of yours like

A candle in the dark of night \
With a smile radiating akin to the moon light

Your head tilts with a massive grin \
My heart skips a beat within

Oh gorgeous girl what am I to do \
I'm falling even more in love with you
