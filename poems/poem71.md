## Feelin' 22

It's the day you turn 22,  \
Leading a beautiful life but with a little blue,  \

A work of art, a human true,  \
Sitting in a car, beside your boo,  \

You my baby, shine bright,  \
The life in you radiates outside,  \

The smarty brains you possess,  \
Focusing on the days you get,  \

Today it is twenty two,  \
Tomorrow it will be ninety two,  \

You'll have a beautiful time,  \
On this earth,  \

With me by your side,  \
Together on the berth,  \

I hope this day is special for you,  \
As much as you are to me,  \

In two years time it'll be,  \
You and me together across the sea,  \

Love you Haffu, meri jaan,  \
I hope you get a lot of aam ðŸ¤­
