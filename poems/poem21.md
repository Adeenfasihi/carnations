## Admiration

Looking out the window, I notice \
The sky is bursting \
Its tears a fallin' \
Awaiting the sun I lay down \
Keep my eyes darting around \
Until my smile turns into a frown \
However by the end of day \
When the sun had set at bay \
Without ever showing its face \
I go out to get a glimpse \
Of what would reveal, the cue to a celebration \
The phases of moon remind me of the elation \
When I spot the crescent \
I fall in admiration \
A moon in the sky and a moon on the earth \
The day was blessed and I hoped as well hers \
The person by my side when no one cared \
It was worth seeing, the expression I beared \
Might just seem like fantasy \
Maybe it will make sense \
Or maybe I'll make you understand \
By removing my absence \
The thing is that it will take some time \
To realise all these dreams of mine \
One day we'll have a place to be \
Where I can see both moons with ease
