## Nights forlorn

In the dark of the nights forlorn /
On the walk towards home, alone /

During the day and when I'm busy /
Even when I'm working or I'm in the city /

When I stop at the junction /
Or if I'm attending a function /

Traveling around in the tube /
Regardless of London being huge /

The thoughts of you flood my brain /
The way it works is kind of insane /

I never thought I'd feel this way /
Where every moment makes me sway /

Will you please be mine /
I'll love you til the end of time
