## Fiery skies

Fiery skies in the background \
A reminder of colours that exist \

With you in the foreground \
Nothing seems to be amiss \

Picking flowers in wayward seasons \
Folding papers with all the reasons \

A lost art that sought a home \
Will find one, as it roams \

In you it seeks, oh beloved, \
The tender warmth it longs for \

Serving its purpose as it now knows \
You are the person, the one it chose
