## Coming to see you

Getting all better thanks to your pecks \
I'm betting on all cards in my decks \
You stand strong, even when you're weak \
Given what they put you through \
Yet you aren't afraid to speak \
The strength you have is to admire \
Anyone who says otherwise is a liar \
So firm on your beliefs you don't budge \
Yet still can't help but give you a nudge \
Being strong does not mean you stand alone \
Baby I'm with you, together we both have grown \
Laughing with tears in our eyes \
We aren't of those who bid goodbyes \
See you later alligator is what we say \
Praying God helps us and makes a way \
Hard times come like tsunamis \
And even though we are busy bees \
Our love will stand strong and bear it all \
I will see you, my love, this coming fall
