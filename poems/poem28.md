## Horizon

Where the sky meets the earth \
Along the horizon we found love

Chasing the moon in moving cars \
Strolling along in beautiful parks

Through satellites we communicate \
Words we use to reciprocate

A smile, a whisper, a touch to crave \
A melody, a dance, and words to pray

Thoughts of you are found rife within \
The depth of me calls you out when

A beep, a ring, a vibration \
Set our mind into motion

Walking on the seashore \
Falling deeper for mi amor

Physical or not so much \
This world is technological

Closing gaps where they exist \
Super nice and duper brisk

Your actions have me adrift \
A sailing boat that is on its way

Towards you I come from far away \
My love without you I'd suffocate
