## Blurry eyes

With blurry eyes \
You see blurry lights

The room once dark \
Now shines bright

A place you can call home \
One you can't explain with words alone

Presence of another human \
That you so adore

Morning kisses, a great start \
To a day that flies past

Rushing through life everyday \
Was the norm is all I'd say

Rife with monotony \
A world of gray

You rub your eyes \
Get out of bed

Look at her, full of peaceful grace \
Dawns on you a realisation afresh

Hafsa, the love of your life, \
Is here to stay
