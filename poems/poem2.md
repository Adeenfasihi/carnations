## From your eyes

From your eyes \
To your toes \
To your pretty little nose

To your laugh \
To your smile \
Which I haven't seen in a while

Your radiance \
Your cheekiness

Your intelligence \
Your kindness

Your mindfullness \
And your fineness

All of it is just \
For you to know it is must

You are amazing \
And I don't say it mildly

Your existence is a light \
Shining on the world brightly
