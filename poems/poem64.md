## Lullaby

I saw u last night \
Your radiance aglow \
Thru the halo you cast \
The waves and particles of light \
Sound abound from deep space \
Sing a lullaby in your name \
Putting you to sleep in the darkness \
Exuding beauty at the harkness \
The fading sounds and light no more \
Is wrong to say as it's much more \
It never fades, it remains \
Temporarily cast over by the sun
