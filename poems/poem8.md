## Selfish desires

Raindrops on the windowsill \
Remind you of years that have been \
Through held tears you mention him \
Once who was your all and now nothing \
A break in your voice had me thinking \
What an unfair world we are living in \

If I could catch your tears in my palms \
If I could hold you, dear, in my arms \
If only I could take your pain away \
If only I could steal your dreams, and hey, \
I wouldn't let you think of yesterday \

People are whack and the past is gone \
You are here and life moves on \
Whoever gives you tears in your eyes \
I would throw them off from a height \

But if there is space for you to mend \
Given distance and the yearn to lend \
I would love to give you a hand \

If it's something you can't solve alone \
You don't have to do it on your own \
But there are things worth fighting for \
If this is it then why are you waiting more \

This is a selfish poem and I \
Do not want to see you cry \

I want my friend to be happy and \
If it's something with which I can help \
I'd be grateful if you could tell
