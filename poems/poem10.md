## Tear ducts 

I sit there clutching my chest \
Hiding the side of my face that's the best \
As we pass olden rustic towns \
Sitting in the train with nothing but a frown \
Traveling through my thoughts on a ship \
The sea of memories troubled with a whip \
Now that the floodgates have opened \
The tearducts seem to have broken \
With the salt comes my pleas \
Oh my God help me please
