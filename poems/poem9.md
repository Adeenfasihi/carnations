## Early days and late nights

Early days and late nights \
Even after all your fights \
You work hard with all your might \
Perhaps you feel inadequate \
And it's a thought that permeates \
Feeling like an imposter \
You hold onto a holster \
In it is your smarty brain \
Yet you let bad thoughts infiltrate \
What they do is eat you up inside \
Leaving you with nowhere to hide \
So come my dear let's change it up \
Good thoughts about you should light it up \
Make you see the colours better \
Especially ones you've adorned forever
