## Book of memories

As I read the book of my memories \
I come up empty in my dreams \
For I have searched long and hard \
To get to the start of it all \
Only then I were to find \
You've always been on my mind \
Sometimes on the front, others back \
With concentration I then stack \
A house of cards replaced by thoughts \
The order of it matters lots \
Given that it's easy to fall \
Even then I can give it my all \
I will never throw my arms \
Till the end you'll see my charms (I hope :p)
