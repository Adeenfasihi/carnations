## Flew away

A week ago I flew away \
To be with you on another day

A year ago was yesterday \
When we both became who we are today

A year to go and a little bit more \
Until I get to come to you \
Bury my face in your chest \
Kiss you til I run out of breath

The time with you felt so surreal \
And feelings that we shared together \
Took pictures we shall cherish forever \
Taste of each other we will remember

Just a little bit more and you'll see \
A year from now we will be \
Together forever, honestly \
You in my arms and me in yours

The world will call us lovebirds \
From whoever we have so far heard \
Gushing on us as a couple \
We will be far more than double
