## Confession to a confession

We'll be waddling around town \
With me on the left as we walk along \
For me it'd be the best sights to see \
With you there beside of me \
And every time I'd want to speak \
I'd be so enchanted my words would sneak

And when we need to stop and take a breath \
I'll put my arms around you, I'll steal some pecks \
A burrito it will be, as I envelop you with warmth \
Even when I've lost 1 Haffa worth of charm \
With less layers to hide behind, you'll realise \
My heart beats just as fast as thine

I'll peck away at your face so meek \
And your mouth that keeps trying to nibble at my cheeks \
All over the country we shall go \
With our love alight and our bodies in tow

Under the starry, moonlit sky \
We lie there, you and I \
Gazing upon the stars, we watch them align \
Holding hands with your head on my arm \
Missing rocket ships, I don't see the harm

With the chocolates I hope to communicate \
My sweet love for you, as the moments accrue \
You validate my actions, recognising them \
While I make your heart melt with love that's true

I'm not used to having a place \
Like the one I've taken up \
But you aren't the only who has space for just one \
Your heart is made of gold and with happiness I beam \
It's a better home for me than in all of my dreams

Your penguin is here, the other half \
A unicorn and a bear, on behalf \
Waddling with you will be a dream realised \
A touch to reveal the fears inside \
A hug to seal the peace without fight \
Teaming up together we'll handle it all \
Our love insurmountable, it will never fall

My words express only things that I can convey \
Too much still remains unexplored away from the bay \
As long as I can, you best believe \
I will write for you even when my words leave \
I pray that you look forward to reading them each \
The poems I write you, and for your heart I reach

It took me a while to understand \
I haven't been the only one who made a stand \
With your love and your heart sincere \
Your answer to my feelings laid bare \
My unicorn, my pengu half, my love, my haseenu \
I couldn't be happier in my life, than with you.
