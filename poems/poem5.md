## Peace in the darkest hours

I look for peace in the darkest hours \
The thought of you and your love for flowers \
Brings me down from the highest towers

You may not realise that this friendship is \
So close to my heart and it feels like bliss

You are someone who's like fire \
Emitting light from the top of the spire

Radiating out your warmth \
Enveloping those who sit around

Some may think you're too bright \
That's their problem, a one of fright

You don't burn those who yearn \
For your company, it's so fun

You are amazing and no less \
I hope you arrive at a place perfect

I wish and pray for you the best \
In this world and in the next
