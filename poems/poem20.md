## Waves

I sit in my room and hear the waves \  
The tide is coming in and the world fades \  
I'm looking for a place to stay \  
In every street I imagine the day \  
Where we could walk with hands intertwined \  
A stroll in the park, and on every incline (Edinburgh is hilly :p) \  
We will be free to explore in our way \  
The beauty of this world, and end up at the bay \  
A sunrise, a sunset, moments we won't forget \  
On the way back we'd get hot drinks \  
Still holding hands and sipping at the brims \  
It starts raining as we head along \  
Without each other it'd feel so wrong \  
The city of literature without the romance \  
Will feel so empty on giving the mirror a glance \  
But with you there my heart rests at ease \  
Even with the unending breeze \  
Slowly then I open my eyes \  
I adjust my focus and get off the high \  
And resume my search as if it's a race \  
So that (you and) I could have a place
