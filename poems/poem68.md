## Flamboyantly flabbergasted

Flamboyantly flabbergasted on finding the store \
Flambergasted is the word I came up with

This is very unlike the moment when I found you \
Deeply embedded in my heart and mind

What makes it different is that it's a feeling \
That I cannot describe, even if I merge words

Such a feeling cannot be expressed on paper \
When you feel it with your body and soul

I look for you in the day and at night \
Think of you whenever I lay my eyes on the sky

Search for the shine of the moon up high \
Which reminds me
