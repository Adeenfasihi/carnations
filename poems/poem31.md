## Grocery store

Walking down a grocery store aisle \
Your eyes light up as you smile

The way you enjoy shopping \
Unwind the kid in you and begin hopping

Purple stuff to match your clothes \
Imagining kisses from me to you at the door

Shopping cart gets a slow start \
We go all around the mart

Get the stuff that we need \
Go around the city with you in the lead

Small coffee shops turn our heads \
We wonder when we will go to bed

Caffeine surging through our bodies \
Waking us up to create our copies

Here I will finish this writing \
With you in tow making things exciting ;)
