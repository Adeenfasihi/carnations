## Wings

You flap your wings \
And fly away

To a place where \
you are going to stay

A struggle to find \
A need to unwind

Feeling dreaded inside \
Searching for a place to hide

When found you lay your head \
On my lap where I take your dread

Planting kisses on your forehead \
Sow flower pots near the river bed

A passion we love to share \
Oh how I love you my dear

We hold back our tender feelings \
Discover new ways to make it exciting

With you, my heart, I tend to give in \
Taking steps with what we begin

The curling toes \
The moans and sighs

Making us shiver in delight \
Once we turn off the light
