## Expressive

Time flashes by like a fast train on track \
Every day is rushing, can you believe that ☀️ \

Weeks have gone and made us close 🗓️ \
A month now engraved and a million more 🌌 \
Love so unfaltering even our mothers adore ♥ \

The wish to see you increases each way ⬇️⬆️⬅️➡️ \
Your tender lips oh so beautiful they slay 💋 \

Hands so gentle like a silvery breeze 🍃 \
Thoughts in the brain you have, oh jeez 🤌 🧠 \

You have eyes like pearls, for you to see 👀 \
How precious, my love, you are to me 💎🏡 \

This coming year we will bond so much 😚 \
Set a standard for us, a lifetimes' such 💯 \

We'll apply those learnings throughout our lives 📖 \
Stand by each other for all the fights🤺 👫 \

Hand in hand we will walk throughout 🤝 \
Embracing each other without a doubt 🤗 🫂 \

Thirty days changed the course of our existence 🫠 \
What we learned is to have great persistence 😤 \

With time we'll be teaching our kids 🧒🏻 ⚽ 🥅 \
The ways of life and turbulence within 🗺 🧘🏻 \

We will teach them the best of ways 🎓 \
To pray, to love, and how not to hate 💝 \

With time we will come to an end 💤 \
Each other beside, my dearest best friend ❣️
