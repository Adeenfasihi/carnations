## As the month begins 

As the month begins \
Your thoughts all get pinned \
Pressure from studying \
Back home and cleaning \
Talking to your friends \
Leaving enough time to repent \
Working for your future \
Just to stand on your feet \
So much responsibility \
You never rest at ease \
Perhaps you could find some solace \
In the words that you read \
Knowing you are not the only one \
Who can see how you feel

Perhaps superfluous \
But there's no disregard \
You know what you know \
No one else can see \
Oh and Dobby is just an elf \
He's not here to set you free \
The knowledge of you struggling \
Observing how you are juggling \
Makes me admire even more \
The qualities that you hold \
Saying amazing is a humble brag \
While your thoughts will feel a nag \
But you are quite truthfully so \
Exceptional and thorough though
