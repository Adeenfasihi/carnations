## Tiring days

Tiring days \
Small breaks

I come home \
To my wife

Baggy eyes \
Become shiny stars

With you there \
Right in my arms

Cooking dinner \
With lame jokes

Gossiping about \
Our day jobs

Laughter fills \
The home we built

Play fights \
That excite

You are the light \
Of my life

Now what started as \
A tiring day

Becomes one \
For which we prayed
