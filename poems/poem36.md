## Reflections

Of all the reflections \
My love you're perfection \

Like sunlight filtered by a tree \
An image of you forms within me \

White rays fall, illuminating the air \
Wanting any woes to disappear \

The way you strike your iconic pose \
And shine the smile that I adore \

Clicking pictures in a space \
Where the sun rays hit your pretty face \

In encrypted form you send one to \
On the receiving end is you know who \

Opening the snap I instinctively smile \
Certain times I put down my mobile \

A flushed face, a wholesome grin \
Fanning the fire ablaze deep within \

Succeed in me reacting, to maybe your relief \
Though by a lot more than you probably believe.
