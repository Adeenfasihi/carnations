## Your eyes lay open 

Your eyes lay open \
Could it be the blue light? \
Can't fall asleep \
Could it be the end of time? \
As you fumble around to find your phone \
The darkness starts seeping inside \
Through the terror of the dreams \
That keep you up at night \
You look for the ray of hope \
The string that you are hanging by \
When you turn on the screen \
You see there's a message saying hi \
Your thoughts light up in the dark \
The shadow goes away in the heart \
You put the phone back under your pillow \
And your heart just starts to billow \
Perhaps the warmth of it \
Could cause you to sleep a bit
