## Daily dose

I've been thinking about this day \
When to Edinburgh I move, away \
Today is the day I'm here to stay \
As a plushie in my bed I lay \

Soft and sweet, a warm embrace \
No need to rush, it's not a race \
When I rest it is what I need \
Slow and steady each other we heed \

I'd play with your hair so curly and soft \
Take in the aroma of your shampoo or...not \
Because the strands would tickle my nose \
I wouldn't want to sneeze and term it a prose \

I love your cheekus and admire your toes \
The way they're shaped I so much adore \
The way you carry yourself on those \
Makes me await my daily dose
