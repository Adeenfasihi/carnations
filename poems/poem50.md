## Purple scrunchie

In a pink dress you lighten up \
A purple scrunchie to top it off \

Lips curled so beautiful \
Enchanting you so become \

With a shy glance you look my way \
Cover your eyes and hide away \

Your hair look the floofiest \
I inadvertently smile the goofiest \

Put my hand on your shoulder \
Feel your muscles tremble \

I take your hand in mine \
Oh it all feels so divine \

Your eyes start darting around \
And you make a pretty little sound \

Placing a kiss at the back of your hand \
I take the other as we stand \

A full moon ðŸŒ• shines on this planet \
Illuminating the surrounding granite \

My heart of stone melts into lava \
Flowing hot at this early hour \

I call your name and wake you, love \
It's time, my dear, my wife, we gotta get up
