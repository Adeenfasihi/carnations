## Shy

Your eyes shy \
Your nose pink \
Your smile, so addictive \

The way you talk, keeps me \
Coming for more, you feel me \

You give me hope, I wanna see \
The future dope, how will it be \

I keep waiting, for the day \
I can hold you, in my arms and say \

I love you, it is the \
Beginning, of what is to be \

We can go, far and wide \
Travel, til the end of time \

In the end, my home will \
Be you and, I hope time sits still
