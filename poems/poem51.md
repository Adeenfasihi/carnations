## Never let go

You pulled me close \
When you thought I was slipping \
You held my hand \
When you thought that I wouldn't \

But baby I want you to know \
That I will never let go \

I wake up in the morning \
With your name on my lips \
Even when I hurt you \
I couldn't go without a kiss \

Hugs I long for \
Remembering our promises \
Your voice like a soothing melody \
Bereft of which my ears can't rest \

Directionless is how I felt \
With you not there at each bend \
Hafsa, meri jaan, you have all of me \
And you are the one I cannot live without
