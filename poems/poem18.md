## Bad day

On a bad day when you look for peace \
I'm not sure how to put you at ease \

Sometimes things become troublesome \
Others, people become meddlesome \

The life that we choose to live \
Gives us the experience in full \

A rainy day could be fruitful for one \
Though the wetter it gets, it dwindles some \

Saying all this does not mean that \
Feeling something is inherently bad \

We all just keep looking for hope, that \
At the end of the night, morning comes
