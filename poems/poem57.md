## Little world

In this little world, \
I saw a form of art,

In the vastness of the universe, \
I could definitely tell her apart,

She was a beautiful human, \
Albeit lonely at heart,

Yesterday we met up, \
In a hot and humid place,

Where we came from, \
A cold and dark space,

The vibrancy struck, \
My stoney heart yearned,

For this bewitching soul, \
That quivered my bones,

Months apart, miles away, \
From yesterday, to what is today

A journey tough, a thorny path, \
The end of which, we wanted fast,

Trials and troughs, have come to pass, \
And present is the now that we want,

To my beautiful fianc√©e, my love, my home, \
Excited I am to scream into the night,

Tell the world, that you're all mine, \
Only one to make me feel,

The way I do, and what it means, \
I love you, is the start of it all,

A future we will build upon, \
We'll hold hands all warm and tight,

Shun the loneliness, and find peace inside, \
With both of us side by side,

A hug to conquer the fears we will have, \
A kiss to seal the promises we'll make,

And with this my love I profess to you, \
With all of my heart, it's only you, \
I'm in love, with all of you.

Yours til the end of time, \
Adeen
