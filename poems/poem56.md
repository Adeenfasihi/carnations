## Taste of you 

So struck in awe at your resilience \
A graceful bow, to your persistence

As the sun rises, and the tide fades \
With faith renewed, it's never too late

Pretty smile, adorable stride \
My girl looking bomb, full of life

In the distance, we wave away \
As it closes, our hearts sway

I rush towards, wrap you in my arms \
A burrito of love, so full of warmth

The taste of you, I will learn that day \
Will never forget, come what may
