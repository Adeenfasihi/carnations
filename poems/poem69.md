## Kingdom of dreams

Welcome to the kingdom of dreams ðŸ¤­ \
The place where sleep lies \
Head falls with a low thump \
Sinks into the cold side of the pillow \
As you make yourself comfortable \
Your hair all over the place \
A strand I stroke away from your face \
Plan a rendez-vous for the softness \
The tenderness of a meet \
Between the honeydewed lips of yours with mine \
I gaze upon your eyes, a galaxy within \
Time stops as I get pulled in \
To the depths of your life and being
