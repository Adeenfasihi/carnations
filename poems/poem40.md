## Autopilot

Years flew by on autopilot \
As you rushed about, putting fights up \

It has been long since you had a break \
The rest you need is nowhere found \

Have a bit more patience til you receive \
All the space you need to find relief \

The time you've lived so far on earth \
Came with a lot of pain and hurt \

Not to disregard the times all fun \
The good ones stuck and the bad undone \

On glancing at the future next \
I can guess for you the best \

Beautiful days are coming ahead \
Ones full of love and trust instead \

And once you get a taste of them \
You'll look forward to more, and then \

Traveling the world is one that you \
Will have a chance for a wish to come true \

On birthdays we will get a cake \
Write a prayer that came true and one we'll make \

Look back at all the years that we lived \
And back to the present, smiling at the gifts \

Nostalgic you will feel at times \
And that, my love, is perfectly alright.
