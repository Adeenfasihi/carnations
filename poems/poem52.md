## Faces sullen 

Of faces sullen \
Places forlorn

Lonely hands \
Company we long for

Faces lit up \
Smiles to die for

A quiver in the voice \
And shimmering eyes

In the distance \
Goes on a fight

Sounds unsettling \
Anger blaring

Alone we are weak \
Which can be tweaked

A presence to feel \
Would make us heal

For you it's me \
In your wake and dreams

And for me it's you \
Whether day or night

Together we'll thrive \
Baby, with your hand in mine
