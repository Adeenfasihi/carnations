## Pretend

From the beginning (but not) til the end \
Each day that we live pretend

Detritus and seedlings of all hopes and dreams \
Turn the field of thoughts so green

Weeds and flowers dwell therein \
It's a place that you have often been

When it comes to stormy times \
Do you, my dear, have a place to hide?

A shelter where you can get some shade \
A body of warmth that you can embrace

Feel free to consider this weary soul \
As your home which you solely own

This gentleman here is proud to say \
I'm right here and I'm here to stay

Doubts naught, I want you true \
In my wake, in the world of dreams too
