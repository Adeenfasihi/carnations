## Words unsaid

In words that are left unsaid \
We can incur an increasing debt \

With you it is so easy to speak \
What is on my mind in a streak \

In the obscurity of the mind \
Lay some thoughts that we unwind \

To you who tells the truth, I hope it is without fear \
I want to express for which how grateful I am, my dear \

Please don't be scared to mention things \
Even ones that to the table aren't easy to bring \

Please do not be afraid to ask \
About feelings that you don't want me to mask \

I am so glad I have you to share \
Even things that aren't easy to bare \

I want this trust to form so true \
A belief in us strong like industrial glue \

If you have ideas to improve \
We can work together to form our groove \

To the end we will take this \
Strong and healthy, a feeling of bliss \

For each other we can become the best \
Until the day we are laid to rest
