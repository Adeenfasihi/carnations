## Transparency

A month has, come to pass \
Like a raindrop, on the glass

The window of eternity, \
Gives us transparency,

To look at things near or far, \
Sunshine, tornados, hail, and all

The comfort is, that we are \
Together in this, hand on heart

Our relation giving us the cover, \
Dedication will not let us suffer,

A one-way mirror is what we have, \
To observe the others from behind the glass,

Touching each other for all the warmth, \
Comforting one another undoing any harm,

Arguments that might arise, \
Disagreements we won't let thrive,

All behind the window wall, \
Kissing your lips, not letting you talk

Holding your face in my hands, \
I whisper to you, my wonderland

I love you to the moon and back, \
Thank you for loving me with all that I lack
