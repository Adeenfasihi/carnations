## Nice weather

The weather was so nice today \
And I saw you again in the bright blue sky \
Shining bright even with a fireball in the sky \
A different sort of beauty \
A touch of silver \
A beacon of hope \
Telling everyone, that even with your craters and your scars \
You can still shine bright \
You can make people smile \
You can make people feel \
Even if just for a split second \
You can stop someone in their tracks as they admire your existence
