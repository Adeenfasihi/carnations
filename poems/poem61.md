## Uni demons

The 5th has come to a pass, \
Carving a path towards the last,

Time to give it your best until you're ready, \
Moments to cherish, hold yourself steady,

Three more to go, in which you gotta show, \
What you got and reveal what's in store,

About time you plan your fyp, \
Make a group that's peppy,

Once the idea is in place, \
You give it time to marinate,

Put it out and let it cook for a while, \
As you sit back and drink non-alcoholic wine (grape juice ðŸ¤­),

To face the uni demons, hit them low, \
With this semester done, you're good to go,

You got dis baby, I believe in you, \
I'll stand by your side through and through
