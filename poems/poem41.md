## Wind chimes

Wind chimes sing in the air \
As the breeze lets itself in \

Falling from the sky, rain drops flail \
And drop on the window sill \

The gusts carry with them a prayer each \
For you my dear who I want them to reach \

A wish for you to make it come true \
Your academic validation, my dear Haffu \

Good luck my love, I shower you with charms \
In the form of kisses, to linger on your arms
