## Hill top

We're on top of the hill \
With the populace below \
It's breezy with a gentle flow

Tourists stride towards the stone \
One by one they climb up on

The sky turns orange \
With the sun on the horizon \
An end to a day with our eyes on

You stare at the distance \
As I close the one between us

You lean with your hands back \
Moving mine on top, I stack

When you turn around to face me \
I pull you in close and kiss thee

A beam of light illuminates \
This scene of ours on the date

Top of the hill we sit together \
Lost in our own world we forget her (Edi, the city)
