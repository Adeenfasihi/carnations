## My Unicorn

I believe this day will end with me entranced in your magic \
You have bewitched me heart and soul so much so that \
I stand outside in the cold wind yet my heart is warm \
The heat envelopes me enough to keep me fuzzy inside \
The tips of my fingers cold yet I feel the blood pulsing inside \
My eyes lay open across the magnificent River Thames \
The sky and the grass shine a vibrant blue and green \
The lapping river, the laughter of children playing nearby \
The sun shining without the slightest hint of shyness \
This day has been etched into my memory and \
For all days to come, you'll forever be my unicorn
