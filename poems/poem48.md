## Story of You & I

Taking off into the sky \
Begins this story of you and I

Friends to best \
And then to lovers

We say it all \
And never surrender

Do we leave behind all the load \
Or push forward and carry it all

It's a life we built \
Cannot just let it go

We need to live \
And thrive in it forevermore

So giddy up \
And let us go

On the journey \
That awaits us yo

We may face some turbulence \
But all is well that ends well

So keep your chin and head up high \
For we, my love, are going to fly
